# ~/.llmist/cli.toml
# Example configuration file for llmist CLI
#
# Copy this file to ~/.llmist/cli.toml to customize CLI defaults.
# All settings are optional - only specify what you want to override.
#
# INHERITANCE: Any section can use `inherits` to inherit settings from other sections.
# - Single inheritance: inherits = "agent"
# - Multiple inheritance: inherits = ["agent", "my-profile"]  (last wins for conflicts)
# - Chain inheritance: A inherits B, B inherits C → A gets all of C's and B's settings
# - Own values always override inherited values
# - Arrays (like gadget) are replaced, not merged

#──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# GLOBAL OPTIONS
# These apply to all commands and override environment variables.
# CLI flags (--log-level, --log-file) still take priority over these.
#──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
