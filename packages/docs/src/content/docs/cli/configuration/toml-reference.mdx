import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The llmist CLI is configured through TOML files and environment variables.

## Configuration File

The CLI loads configuration from `~/.llmist/cli.toml`:

```bash
    # Initialize with default config
    npx @llmist/cli init
    ```

### Basic Structure

```toml
# ~/.llmist/cli.toml

[complete]
model = "anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5"
temperature = 0.7

[agent]
model = "anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5"
max-iterations = 15
gadget = ["~/gadgets/common-tools.ts"]
```

### Inheritance

Sections can inherit settings from parent sections:

```toml
[agent]
model = "anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5"
max-iterations = 15

[code-review]
inherits = "agent"
temperature = 0.3
system = "You are a code reviewer."
```

### Custom Commands

Create custom commands with a `type` field:

```toml
[code-review]
type = "agent"
description = "Review code for bugs and best practices."
system = "You are a senior code reviewer."
max-iterations = 5
gadget = ["~/gadgets/code-tools.ts"]
```

Run with:

```bash
    npx @llmist/cli code-review "Review my PR"
    ```

### Prompt Templates

Define reusable prompts with Eta templating:

```toml
[prompts]
base-assistant = "You are a helpful AI assistant."
expert = """
<%~ include("@base-assistant") %>
You are also an expert in <%= it.field %>.
"""

[my-expert]
system = '<%~ include("@expert", {field: "TypeScript"}) %>'
```

### File Includes

Load prompt content from external files with `includeFile()`:

```toml
[prompts]
# Load entire prompt from file
from-file = '<%~ includeFile("~/.llmist/prompts/custom.md") %>'

# Mix file content with inline content
hybrid = """
<%~ include("@base-assistant") %>
<%~ includeFile("./prompts/project-rules.txt") %>
"""

[code-review]
system = '<%~ includeFile("~/.llmist/prompts/code-review.md") %>'
```

**Path resolution:**
- `~` expands to home directory
- Relative paths resolve from config file location
- Included files can themselves use `includeFile()` and `include()`
- Circular includes are detected and prevented

## Gadget Approval

The gadget approval system provides a safety layer for potentially dangerous gadget executions.

### Approval Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `allowed` | Gadget executes immediately |
| `denied` | Gadget is rejected, LLM receives denial message |
| `approval-required` | User is prompted before execution |

### Default Behavior

By default, these gadgets require approval:

- **`RunCommand`** - Executes shell commands
- **`WriteFile`** - Creates or modifies files
- **`EditFile`** - Edits existing files

All other gadgets default to `allowed`.

### Configuration

```toml
[agent]
gadget-approval = { WriteFile = "allowed", Shell = "denied", ReadFile = "allowed" }
```

### Wildcard Default

Set default mode for all unconfigured gadgets:

```toml
[agent]
gadget-approval = { "*" = "denied", ReadFile = "allowed", FloppyDisk = "allowed" }
```

### Example Configurations

**High-Security Mode:**
```toml
[agent]
gadget-approval = {
  WriteFile = "denied",
  EditFile = "denied",
  RunCommand = "denied",
  ReadFile = "allowed"
}
```

**Trust All Mode:**
```toml
[agent]
gadget-approval = { "*" = "allowed" }
```

**Selective Approval:**
```toml
[agent]
gadget-approval = {
  RunCommand = "approval-required",
  WriteFile = "allowed",
  DeleteFile = "denied"
}
```

### Approval Prompts

For file operations, a colored diff is shown:

```
🔒 Approval required: Modify src/index.ts

--- src/index.ts (original)
+++ src/index.ts (modified)
@@ -1,3 +1,4 @@
 import { foo } from './foo';
+import { bar } from './bar';

   ⏎ approve, or type to reject:
```

- **Press Enter** or type **`y`** to approve
- **Type any other text** to reject (sent to LLM as feedback)

### Non-Interactive Mode

When running non-interactively (e.g., in scripts or CI), `approval-required` gadgets are automatically denied.

## Environment Variables

### API Keys

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
export GEMINI_API_KEY="..."
```

### Logging

```bash
export LLMIST_LOG_LEVEL="debug"   # silly, trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal
```

:::note[Session-Based Logging]
Each CLI session automatically creates its own log directory at `~/.llmist/logs/<session-name>/` with a memorable name like `sunny-falcon`. Numbers are only appended when there's a name collision (e.g., `sunny-falcon-2`). Session logs are stored in `session.log.jsonl` within that directory.

### Global CLI Flags

These flags work with any command:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--log-level <level>` | Set log level |
| `--version` | Show version number |
| `--help` | Show help |
