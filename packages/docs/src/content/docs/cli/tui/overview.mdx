When running `llmist agent` in an interactive terminal, you get access to a rich Terminal User Interface (TUI) that helps you monitor and interact with the agent's execution.

## Features

### Interactive Blocks

Each LLM call and gadget execution is displayed as a collapsible block:

- **LLM calls** show the streaming response in real-time
- **Gadget executions** show parameters, status, and results
- **Expand/collapse** any block to see full details

### Real-time Status Bar

The status bar at the bottom shows:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Mode | Current mode: `BROWSE`, `INPUT`, or `FOCUSED` |
| Profile | Active profile name (when using custom profiles) |
| Tokens | Input/output tokens used (↑ input, ↓ output, ⤿ cached) |
| Cost | Estimated cost in USD |
| Time | Elapsed time for current operation |
| Throttled | Rate limiting active: `⏸ Throttled Xs` shows delay |
| Retry | Retry in progress: `🔄 Retry N/M` shows attempt |
| Activity | Active LLM calls and gadget executions with spinner |

### Rate Limiting & Retry Indicators

**Throttling Indicator:**
When proactive rate limiting delays a request, you'll see:
```
⏸ Throttled 3s | ...
```

This appears when approaching configured rate limits (RPM/TPM). A conversation entry shows:
```
[Rate limit] Waiting 3s (RPM: 45/50, TPM: 38K/40K)
```

**Retry Indicator:**
When automatic retry is active after an error, you'll see:
```
🔄 Retry 2/3 | ...
```

This shows the current attempt and total retries configured. Retry reason appears in conversation history.

**Configuration:**
- Control rate limits via TOML `[rate-limits]` section or `--rate-limit-rpm` flag
- Control retry via TOML `[retry]` section or `--max-retries` flag
- See [CLI Configuration](/cli/configuration/toml-reference/) for details

### Raw Request/Response Viewer

Debug LLM interactions by viewing:
- Raw JSON request sent to the provider
- Full response payload received

<Aside type="tip">
  Press `r` to view the raw request and `R` to view the raw response for the selected block.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑` / `k` | Select previous block |
| `↓` / `j` | Select next block |
| `Enter` | Toggle expand/collapse selected block |
| `r` | View raw request |
| `R` | View raw response |
| `Ctrl+B` | Toggle browse/input mode |
| `Ctrl+C` (×2) | Quit agent |

<Aside type="note">
  Vim-style navigation with `j`/`k` is supported for users familiar with that workflow.
</Aside>

## Browse vs Input Mode

The TUI has two modes:

1. **Input Mode** (default) - Type messages to send to the agent
2. **Browse Mode** - Navigate through execution history

Toggle between modes with `Ctrl+B`. In browse mode, you can:
- Navigate blocks with arrow keys or `j`/`k`
- Expand blocks to see full content
- Inspect raw LLM payloads

## Non-Interactive Mode

When running without a TTY (e.g., in scripts or CI), the TUI is disabled and output is streamed directly to stdout:

```bash
    # Runs without TUI
    echo "How many floppies for DOOM.ZIP?" | npx @llmist/cli agent -g ./floppy.ts

    # Use --quiet to suppress all output except gadget results
    npx @llmist/cli agent "Check my high score" -g ./arcade.ts --quiet
    ```
